Transversal Project: Data Measurement and Visualization
Project Overview
The objective of this project was to measure environmental data in three classrooms within an engineering school building. The collected data is transmitted to a server for storage and later retrieval, enabling real-time visualization and analysis through a dedicated website. Additionally, the system allows users to vary the measurement period of the sensors.

This project was developed in collaboration with the NRTech association.

Features
Data Measurement: Collects data from various sensors installed in three classrooms.
Data Transmission: Sends collected data to a centralized server.
Data Retrieval: Allows for easy access to data for visualization on a web platform.
Customizable Measurement Period: Users can adjust the frequency of data collection based on their needs.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: [Specify languages, e.g., Python, JavaScript]
Frameworks: [Specify frameworks, e.g., Flask, React]
Database: [Specify database, e.g., MySQL, MongoDB]
Server: [Specify server technology, e.g., Node.js, Apache]
Sensors: [List types of sensors used]
