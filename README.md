#Transversal Project: Data Measurement and Visualization
#Project Overview
The objective of this project was to measure environmental data in three classrooms within an engineering school building. The collected data is transmitted to a server for storage and later retrieval, enabling real-time visualization and analysis through a dedicated website. Additionally, the system allows users to vary the measurement period of the sensors.

This project was developed in collaboration with the NRTech association.

Features
Data Measurement: Utilizes the SHT21 sensor and ESP32 microcontroller to measure temperature.
Data Transmission: Sends collected data to the ThingSpeak server via the MQTT messaging protocol.
Data Retrieval: Allows for easy access to data for visualization on a web platform developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Customizable Measurement Period: Users can adjust the frequency of data collection based on their needs.
Technologies Used
Microcontroller: ESP32
Sensor: SHT21
Programming Languages: Python (for microcontroller code), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web development)
Data Transmission Protocol: MQTT
Server: ThingSpeak
